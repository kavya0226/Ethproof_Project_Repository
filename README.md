## Token Objective 

Develop a smart contract capable of implementing a custom token with the functionalities to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens. This contract should include public variables for token details and a mapping structure to record addresses and their respective balances. The mint and burn functions must be designed with appropriate conditionals to uphold data consistency.

## Smart Contract Token Introduction 

Welcome to the Simple Token (ST) Smart Contract repository. This repository contains a basic Solidity smart contract that implements a simple token system. Below, you'll find an introduction to the smart contract, detailed code explanations, compilation instructions, deployment steps, and an introduction to Remix, the online Solidity IDE.

Contract Overview and Variables: The contract defines a custom token named "Tokening." It introduces public variables to store critical token details. The tokenName variable holds the name of the token ("Kavya"), the tokenSymbol variable stores its symbol ("ABCD"), and the totalSupply variable represents the initial total supply of the token, which is set to 0. These variables provide essential metadata about the token and are accessible externally for transparency and querying purposes.

## Code Explanations

**string public tokenName and string public tokenSymbol** declare the name and symbol of the token, respectively. These properties provide users with essential information about the token.

**uint256 public totalSupply** keeps track of the total supply of ST tokens. It starts at 0 and increases whenever new tokens are minted.

**Token Balances**

mapping(address => uint256) public balances is a data structure that maps Ethereum addresses to their ST token balances. This mapping allows users to query their balance with balances[address].

**Minting Tokens**

The mint function enables anyone to create new ST tokens and assign them to a designated Ethereum address.
```solidity
function mint(address _to, uint256 _value) external
```
**address _to** is the Ethereum address to which the newly created tokens will be assigned.

**uint256 _value** is the number of ST tokens to create and assign to the _to address.

This function increases the total supply by _value and updates the balance of the recipient. It's commonly used for token minting, such as in ICOs or as rewards.

**Burning Tokens (burnTokens Function)**

The burn function allows token holders to destroy a specific number of ST tokens from their balance.

```solidity
function burnTokens(uint256 _value) external
```
**uint256 _value** is the number of ST tokens to burn. The sender must have at least this amount in their balance for the transaction to succeed.
This function decreases the total supply by _value and adjusts the balance of the sender, effectively destroying tokens. Burning tokens is a common operation to reduce the token supply or implement deflationary mechanisms.

**Compilation**
You can compile this Solidity smart contract using the Solidity compiler (solc) or Remix. Below are the steps for using Remix:

**Deployment**

To deploy the Simple Token (ST) Smart Contract, follow these steps:

Compile the Smart Contract: Ensure the contract compiles successfully in Remix.

Select Environment: In Remix, choose the appropriate environment (JavaScript VM, Injected Web3, or a custom network such as Ethereum Mainnet or a testnet).

Deploy the Contract: Click the "Deploy" button in Remix to deploy the contract to the selected environment.

Confirm Transaction: Confirm the transaction in your wallet (if using an external provider).

Interact with the Contract: After deployment, interact with the contract by calling its functions from within Remix or any other Ethereum-compatible application.

**Introduction to Remix**

Remix is a web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed for Solidity smart contract development. It offers a user-friendly interface with features for code editing, compilation, deployment, and debugging. Here's how to get started with Remix:

Visit Remix.

Select an environment (e.g., JavaScript VM for testing or Injected Web3 for interaction with real Ethereum networks).

Write or import your Solidity code.

Compile your code by clicking the "Compile" tab.

Deploy your contract using the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.

Interact with your deployed contract and monitor transactions in the "Deployed Contracts" section.
